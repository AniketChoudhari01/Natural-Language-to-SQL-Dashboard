# Natural Language to SQL Dashboard

**Hackathon Project: 3-Hour Challenge**  

An intelligent business dashboard that allows users to ask business questions in **plain English** and automatically generates SQL queries using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system executes the queries on a structured SQLite database and visualizes the results in tables, KPI cards, and interactive charts.

## Hackathon Problem

The challenge was to **build an intelligent business dashboard** that:

- Understands natural language questions from users  
- Converts them into SQL queries  
- Executes them on business datasets  
- Visualizes insights through KPI cards, tables, and charts  

**Time Limit:** 3 Hours  

You were provided with datasets from Kaggle and had to **clean, structure, and import them into a SQLite database** before building the dashboard.

---

## Problem Statement

Build a web application where:

- Users ask questions in plain English  
- An LLM generates SQL queries automatically  
- Queries are executed on the database  
- Results are displayed clearly with visual insights  

The goal is to simplify business analytics and empower non-technical users to explore business data efficiently.

---

## Project Flow

The project follows this workflow:

1. **User Input**  
   - User types a business question into a text box on the frontend.  
   - Example: `"Show top 5 customers by revenue"`  

2. **API Call to Backend**  
   - Frontend sends the question to a backend API endpoint `/ask`.  
   - Backend processes the request using an LLM to generate SQL.  

3. **SQL Execution**  
   - The generated SQL query is executed on the SQLite database.  
   - Results are fetched and formatted as JSON.  

4. **Response to Frontend**  
   - Backend returns JSON containing:  
     - `sql`: The generated SQL query  
     - `results`: The query results  

5. **UI Rendering**  
   - **SQL Display:** Shows the generated SQL query  
   - **KPI Cards:** Calculates and displays key metrics (revenue, orders, customers)  
   - **Results Table:** Displays query results in a clear, bordered table  
   - **Charts:** Displays interactive visualizations if the result is not a single scalar value  

---

## Core Features (Achieved)

1. **Natural Language Query Interface**  
   - User types plain English questions  
   - LLM converts questions to SQL queries  
   - SQL executes on database and results are returned  

2. **Business KPI Dashboard**  
   - Calculates and displays metrics such as revenue, total orders, and number of customers  
   - Real-time visualization using cards with clear styling  

3. **Interactive Data Visualization**  
   - Results are visualized using charts (bar, line, pie)  
   - Allows filtering by date ranges or categories  

**Pending Feature:**  
4. **Smart Query Management** (not yet implemented)  
   - Save queries, templates, history, and LLM-suggested follow-ups

- **Query Input:** Simple text box for asking questions  
- **SQL Display:** Shows the SQL generated by the LLM  
- **KPI Cards:** Summarizes key business metrics at a glance  
- **Results Table:** Clear tabular output with full borders and alternating row colors  
- **Charts:** Interactive bar/line/pie charts to analyze trends and performance  

**Flow Example:**

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Python Flask/FastAPI for API endpoints and LLM integration  
- **Database:** SQLite with business data  
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face API

## Database Setup

| Table Name  | Columns |
|------------|---------|
| **customers** | `id`, `name`, `email`, `city`, `signup_date` |
| **products**  | `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `stock` |
| **orders**    | `id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `order_date`, `total` |
| **sales**     | `id`, `order_id`, `revenue`, `profit_margin`, `sales_date` |
